# ESP32_C3_DevKitM_1
Arduino sketches for ESP32 C3

So first install correct USB drivers for windows: CP210x. This is a zip-file and via Device Manager (Apparaatbeheer) update the driver for USB.

Than download Arduino . I used the old Arduino IDE, but newest shoud work also.
Install ESP32 boards from espressif. But choose 2.0.0 and not newer. The ESP32-c3 in the devkit is no longer supported in the newer versions.
